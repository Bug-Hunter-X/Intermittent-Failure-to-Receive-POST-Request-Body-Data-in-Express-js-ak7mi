# Intermittent POST Request Body Data Failure in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a bug where an Express.js application intermittently fails to receive the body data from POST requests. The `req.body` remains empty, despite having `app.use(express.json())` correctly set up.  The issue is often related to the order of middleware execution or unexpected request behavior.

## Bug Description

The server is designed to receive JSON data via POST requests to the `/data` endpoint.  However, under load or certain conditions, the `req.body` is unexpectedly empty, leading to errors or incorrect functionality.

## Solution

The solution involves using a more robust method of handling request bodies to prevent timing issues or ensure that the middleware is executed correctly.
